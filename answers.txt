Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git allows multiple people to collaborate on a large, complicated 
project from one repository. People can work on their own tasks in 
branches, testing solutions and making changes without worrying about 
disrupting the main project, then having their finished solution verfied 
and pushed back to main. It also allows public/open source code projects 
to be made easily accesible and organized. 

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science is commonly applied to psychology. Not only is 
careful experimental design particularly important, but careful statistical analysis of well organized 
data is vital since topics in this field are often sensitive.
